### Description:
Wait wait! Let me guess. Your largest hurdle in your Window 10 upgrade is your application portfolio. Checking compatibility with new windows versions, acquiring new companies and mapping their applications to your library, or reinstalling applications when reimaging a user's computer. These are all difficult tasks, but data can help! Here are some tricks that can help you do some data-mining against your applications in ConfigMgr.

### What you will learn:
* Use the MSI engine to query your MSI based packages\application in order to quickly data mining.
* Suggestions for speeding up the application rationalization process and identifying what applications are on your systems.
* A guide for setting up and automated application smoke testing environment for your apps.
