### Description:

I don’t always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production… PowerShell authors, is this you? While many PowerShell authors have a desire to test their code, many lack the tools and skillset to enable a continuous testing ecosystem for their automations. In this session, we’ll explain what Pester is, how it works and create automated unit tests for PowerShell scripts. We’ll cover PowerShell authoring best practices as it relates to automated unit testing and use Visual Studio Team Services to incorporate that into a CI/CD pipeline for any PowerShell script. Testing is a core pillar to DevOps and tools like Pester and VSTS can help you achieve that with PowerShell.

### What you will learn:

* Understand the basics of Pester
* Be able to build a Pester test
* Understand the importance of continuous testing
* Add automated testing to CI/CD pipeline for PowerShell
