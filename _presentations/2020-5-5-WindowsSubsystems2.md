### Description:
Adventure with us as we strive to make your life easier by venturing into an exploration of some of the Windows sub-systems and components that are still somehow unappreciated. This should help you out on a daily basis, providing you with a better understanding that can help you get even more out of them. In this broad-ranging talk, we'll wander through the mystery of some of these must-know Windows subsystems.

### What you will learn:
* What the Windows Registry actually is, how it's assembled, and what it's hiding from you
* Basic understanding of WMI structure and function
* How Windows telemetry and data are gathered and submitted to Microsoft.
