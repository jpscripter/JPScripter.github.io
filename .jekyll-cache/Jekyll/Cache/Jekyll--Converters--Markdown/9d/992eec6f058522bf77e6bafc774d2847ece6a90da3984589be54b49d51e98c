<p>Makes a modern Object based APIs for the windows OS. This is one of the reasons windows is an API based OS vs Linux being file based.</p>

<p>Built on the Common information Model (CIM), and wbem standards used by other OS but Microsoft added it’s own spin on it with wmi. This groups information in related Object classes and leverages providers to manage those objects.</p>
