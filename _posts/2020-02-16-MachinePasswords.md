## What is a CTE?
Common Table Expression is like a temporary view that resides in a query. It is declared in the query and used to pre-sort or organize data before using it in your main query. 

## Use Cases

### Aggregating data

You can apply data aggregation to a table or view before you get to join it with another table. In the past, I have used this to get the return only first entry of a type from a table.
``` sql



```
###  Transforming data multiple times

You can also use a CTE to apply multiple transformations to data in a more readable fashion.

``` Powershell



```
